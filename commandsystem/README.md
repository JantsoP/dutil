# commandsystem

Simple command system you can use for discord bots, it has generated help menus and automatically parses arguments

Documentation is very lacking atm because the system itself is very rough, once i clean it up and think it's ready i will make documentation for it

It's currently changing a lot, i wouldn't reccomend using it yet unless you are okay with changing stuff

Command argument types supported:

 - String
 - Number
 - User
